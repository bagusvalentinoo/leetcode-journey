<p>You are given an array of characters <code>letters</code> that is sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, and a character <code>target</code>. There are <strong>at least two different</strong> characters in <code>letters</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the smallest character in </em><code>letters</code><em> that is lexicographically greater than </em><code>target</code>. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in <code>letters</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
<strong>Output:</strong> "c"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
<strong>Output:</strong> "f"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
<strong>Output:</strong> "x"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
