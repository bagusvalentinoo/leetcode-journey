<hr />

<p>Your friend is typing his <code>name</code> into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character <code>c</code>, the key might get <em>long pressed</em>, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.</p>

<p>You examine the <code>typed</code> characters of the keyboard. Return <code>True</code> if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.</p>
